                    change on 25 May 2018. Although this Privacy Policy sets out most of your rights under the new laws,
                    we may not yet be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer
                    of your personal data) until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for
                    some of these changes.
                    We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of
                    any material changes by way of a pop-up notice on the Site announcing that the Privacy Policy has
                    changed. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please
                    keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

                    <strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong> means processing your personal data
                    where it is
                    necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.

                <h4 class="mb-2">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
                <p>You have the right to:

                    <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access
                    request"). This
                    enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
                    lawfully processing it.

                    <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
                    have any
                    incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy
                    of the new data you provide to us.

                    <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
                    remove personal data
                    where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
                    delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
                    processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
                    required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always
                    be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to
                    you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

                    <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
                    interest (or those
                    of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
                    object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
                    You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
                    purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
                    your information which override your rights and freedoms.

                    <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
                    to suspend the
                    processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the
                    data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
                    where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
                    exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
                    verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

                    <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will
                    provide to you, or a
                    third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                    format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided
                    consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

                    <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your
                    personal data. However,
                    this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
                    If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise
                    you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
